1. Create array of object of a class Rectangle. Create a  AreaCalculatorManager Class having method say printAreaofObjects(This method takes argument as array of object and calls the calArea() method of each object) 
	Make sure while creating the Rectangle class, the class has 
	a. Default contructor which assigns some deafult vale to len and bred of each object 
	b. Create a parametric contructor which take len and bred as argument and assigns the value to the class member len and bred
	c. Make sure to use the default as well parametric contructor while creating the Rectangle object

	class Rectangle{

	int len;
	int bred;

	default constructor
	parametric constructor

	public void calArea(){
	System.out.println("Area of the current object is " + this.len*this.bred)
	}
	}


	class AreaCalculatorManager{

	public void printAreaofObjects(Rectangle objects[]){

	//call each reactangle instance calArea() method 
	}
	}

Note: Make sure to use the AreaCalculatorManager instance in the Driverclass
