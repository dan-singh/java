1. Create a class say Email with data members with access specifier with private. Provide the getter and setter methods for the data members

2. Create a class in such a way that we not allowed to create more than one instance i.e. if one instance is created then no other instance for the class allowed to create
	hint:
	- Think how we can restric the constructor call 
	- Think how can you call method without creating an instance, such that this method return an instance of the class as a return type
